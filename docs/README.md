# Iskra Documentation

[Iskra](https://github.com/michaeltukdev/Iskra) is a **free and open-source** distributed monitoring tool primarily for Home Lab enjoyers, like the creator of this project. It allows you to connect multiple servers, referenced as 'nodes' within this project, to a centralised dashboard letting you have full access to all your home labs information in one place.



There's quite a lot of functionality within this simplistic modern application to tell you all about. But here's a quick rundown with links to those specific sections:

* Centralized dashboard allowing you to monitor all your nodes from a single, intuitive interface.
* Get immediate real-time updates and insights into your system's performance and status.
* Track metrics that matter to you, with full customisability over the metrics and dashboard.
* Designed and built using modern technology, Go, NextJS and Docker to run seamlessly on minimal hardware anywhere anytime.
* Add, remove, or configure nodes effortlessly in a few clicks.
* The best part? It's built for the community, by the community.
